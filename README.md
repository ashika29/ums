# University management website for Hogwarts

With basic html, css and javascript skills, I tried to develop a website for an imaginary university.
- I'm learning advanced web development technologies to create beautiful, smooth & optimized websites!
- Please do drop your valuable comments on the website.


*Note:
- This was the very first HTML project that was left as a static HTML code somewhere in 2017. Hence, deploying it to [Basic University Management System](https://ashika29.github.io/ums/) website for anyone to veiw it easily!
- It's funny how we develop such sites out of such creativity and thought although years later it all seems like a very basic funny site ;)
